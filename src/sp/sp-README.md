❄ Customizable Snowflake Generator ❄

Course: Core Concepts in Computer Science
Student: Elma Mostic
Date: November 2024

Overview:
This program lets you create your own unique snowflake using Python's turtle graphics.
You can customize:

- Snowflake color
- Snowflake size
- Number of branches
- Branch style (simple, fancy, or nature/tree-like)

It demonstrates key programming concepts:
- Variables - storing your choices
- Functions - breaking tasks into reusable code
- Loops - repeating patterns (like branches)
- Conditionals - deciding styles and colors
- User input - interacting with the program

How to Use:
1. Run the program in a Python environment that supports turtle.
2. Follow the prompts to choose:
   - Color (classic white, light blue, silver, rainbow, or a surprise!)
   - Size (small, medium, large)
   - Number of branches (4–12)
   - Branch style (simple, fancy, or nature/tree-like)
3. Watch as your custom snowflake is drawn on the screen.
4. Optionally, add falling snow decorations.
5. Click anywhere on the screen to close the program when finished.

Features:
- Rainbow Mode: Each branch can have a different color.
- Nature Branches: Recursive tree-like patterns for a realistic look.
- Fancy Branches: Decorative branch patterns for a fancy snowflake.
- Falling Snow: Adds random snow dots for a snowy scene.

Notes:
- If you enter invalid inputs (like a number outside 4–12 for branches), the program uses default values.
